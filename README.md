# 💼 Amazon Sales Dashboard – Made with Tableau Public

Hey there! 👋  
This project is a simple and clean Tableau dashboard that I built to explore and visualize Amazon’s global sales data. It helped me understand how cost, revenue, and profit vary across different regions and countries — and it was super fun to make! 😊

- 📊 A **Unit Cost** bar chart for easy comparison across countries  
- 🎈Bubble charts for **Unit Price** and **Units Sold** — super visual and intuitive
